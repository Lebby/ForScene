ForScene is a library based on PlayN framework.

Disclaimer:
This project is in a "pre-alpha" phase.
Many concept must be simplified and fixed. I want to develop "simply to use" library.
I'm thinking to offer "full-access" to each data in class because I hope to develope a GUI to use this library to offer an easy tool to build demos/games/presentations.
This library is HEAVILY BASED ON PLAYN.
I'll add documentation and refer to playN project and its authors in "documentation" phase.
Now, code is ugly and not documented ... you can read "debug lines and old code" and other things ... please don't care to them! 
If you're of PlayN Projects and you something wrong, you can send email to glscud@gmail.com.   

Purpose:
It's purpose is to offer a layer to easy manage scene and not layer.
Scene is a logical collection of layers and Scene Objects. 
Scene Object is a logical view of multiple Layers.
A Scene Object can be combined to create complex objects.
I'm developing effects that can be have Scene object as target.
I have developed a small event-driven management of scene building process and effect.
   

I want to develop by this library a "Monkey Island"-like game ... then i focus on all I needs to achieve this target!
